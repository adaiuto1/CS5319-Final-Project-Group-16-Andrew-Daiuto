Welcome to the mushroom show! The place to be if you want to stay up to date with everything going on in the world of mushrooms.
You always said one day, but I always said now. Now you've waited too long. Thought I was weak but you proved I was strong.
The things we wished for, the things we dreamed of. We thought they would just appear and our lives would start. But nothing starts without you. So why don't we become the stories we told ourselves?
I'll show you what I'm made of. Rise to the occasion, got fears but I'll face them.
Only illogics find hidden flaws in the straight logic lines. Only erratics can find errors and faults in such a perfect design.
We're called neons, sinners plucked from hell to do God's dirty work. But I find it hard to believe we're in heaven.
Old friends, ex-lovers. Only one of us can stay in heaven. And I've still got a score to settle.
